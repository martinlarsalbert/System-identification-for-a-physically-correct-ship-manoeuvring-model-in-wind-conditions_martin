Two different modular manoeuvring models are used in this paper; They both have identical prediction models for the hull and propeller forces, but different models for the rudder forces. The Physics informed model has a new deterministic semi-empirical rudder model -- proposed in this paper (see \autoref{sec:semiempirical_rudder_model}). The mathematical model -- referred to as the Abkowitz model -- has a data driven mathematical rudder model. 
Except the changed rudder models, the manoeuvring models are similar to the MMG model \citep{yasukawa_introduction_2015}, with some minor enhancements that are presented in the next section.
