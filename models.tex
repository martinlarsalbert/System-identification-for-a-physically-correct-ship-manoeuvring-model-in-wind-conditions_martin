The ship's kinematics are expressed at midship 
in the surge $X$, sway $Y$, and yaw $N$ degrees of freedoms (see \autoref{fig:reference_frames}) described by \autoref{eq:X}-\autoref{eq:N}, where $X_D$, $Y_D$, and $N_D$ describe the damping forces and moments. Note that these equations have the added mass coupling terms: $Y_{\dot{r}}$, and $N_{\dot{v}}$ -- which are neglected in the MMG model.

where the subscripts: H, P, R, and RHI represent contributions from: hull, propellers, rudders, and rudder hull interaction. Rudder hull interaction having its own element is a difference to the MMG model, where RHI is included in the hull forces.
% Hull:

The hull forces are expressed with the same polynomials as the MMG model, except that the ${X_{vvvv}}'$ coefficient has been omitted and an additional resistance term ${X_u}'$ has been added -- to allow for a more nonlinear resistance (see \autoref{sec:hull}). The nonlinear resistance is possible due to the use of perturbed velocity (see \autoref{sec:prime_system}).

%Propellers:
The total twin screw propeller forces are expressed as,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:X_P}
    \input{equations/mathematical_model_kinetics.X_P}
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Y_P}

\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:N_P}
    \input{equations/mathematical_model_kinetics.N_P}
\end{equation}
The surge forces from the propellers are calculated as the propeller thrust times a thrust deduction coefficient $X_{thrust}=(1-t)$ as shown in \autoref{eq:X_P_port} and a small yawing moment contribution as seen in \autoref{eq:N_P_port}, where $y_{pport}$ is the propellers transverse coordinate. The thrusts from the propellers $T_{port},T_{stbd}$ are taken from the the model tests measurements, and VCT calculations, since modelling of propeller forces is not of primary focus in this paper.

\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:N_P_port}
    \input{equations/mathematical_model_kinetics.N_P_port}
\end{equation}

%Rudder hull interaction:
There is an interaction effect between the rudder and hull; The flow in the ship's aft is influenced by the rudder -- which generates lift on the hull surface; Forces from rudder actions are thus generated both on the rudder and on the hull. This effect is modelled by the coefficients $\alpha_H$ and $x_H$ as seen in \autoref{eq:Y_RHI} and \autoref{eq:N_RHI}. This is a changed formulation to the MMG model -- to simplify for regression.

The mathematical rudder model (\autoref{sec:mathematical_rudder_model}) is expressed as a truncated third order Taylor expansion, similar to \citet{abkowitz_ship_1964}. 
The semi-empirical rudder is a new compilation of existing semi-empirical formulas from the literature, which is presented in the next section.
